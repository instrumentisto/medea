//! Provides [`PeerTrafficWatcher`] trait and its impl.
//!
//! [`PeerTrafficWatcher`] analyzes [`Peer`] traffic metrics and send messages
//! ([`PeerStarted`], [`PeerStopped`], [`PeerFailed`]) to [`Room`].
//!
//! Traffic metrics, consumed by [`PeerTrafficWatcher`] can originate from
//! different sources:
//!
//! 1. [`FlowMetricSource::Peer`] - Peer, received from member that owns target
//!    [`Peer`].
//!
//! 2. [`FlowMetricSource::PartnerPeer`] - Partner Peer, received from member,
//!    that owns [`Peer`], connected to target [`Peer`].
//!
//! 3. [`FlowMetricSource::Coturn`] - Coturn, reported by Coturn TURN server.
//!
