//! Client API protocol implementation for Medea media server.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - `jason`: Enables [`Deserialize`] implementation for [`Event`]s, and
//! [`Serialize`] implementation for [`Command`]s.
//! - `medea`: Enables [`Deserialize`] implementation for [`Command`]s, and
//! [`Serialize`] implementation for [`Event`]s.
//! - `extended-stats`: Enables unused RTC Stats DTOs.
//!
//! # Contribution guide
//!
//! Avoid using 64 bit types. [`medea-jason`] uses [wasm-bindgen] to interop
//! with JS, and exposing 64 bit types to JS will make [wasm-bindgen] to use
//! [BigInt64Array][2] / [BigUint64Array][3] in its JS glue, which are not
//! implemented or were implemented too recently in some UAs.
//!
//! So its better to keep protocol 64-bit-types-clean to avoid things breaking
//! by accident.
